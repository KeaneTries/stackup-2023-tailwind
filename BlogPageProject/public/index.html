     Tailwind CSS is a popular and <span class="italic font-bold text-blue-500">powerful CSS

     can be used across an entire website or application. This helps to
     ensure that all elements are styled consistently, which can make it

    <p>
     Examples of such utility classes includes the
     <span class="font-bold">"text-center"</span> class can be used to center align text,
     while the <span class="font-bold">"bg-gray-200"</span> class can be used to add a light
     gray background color to an element.
